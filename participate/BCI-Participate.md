# Brain-Computer Interfacing
{:.center}

We are recruiting adults aged 18 years or older. Please continue reading for more information!

# What is the Purpose of the Project?
Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use an input signal from the brain to perform computerized tasks. They typically use two types of stimuli, target and non-target, which produce different and detectible brain signal patterns when attended to. When the user attends to a stimulus, it becomes the target, and the difference between the brain signals produced in response to a *target* and *non-target* stimuli allow the computer to detect which which stimulus the user is attending to, and perform the corresponding task. The larger the differences between the brain signals elicited from target and non-target stimuli, the easier they can be detected and the better the BCI system can be. Therefore, our goal is to optimize BCI performance by maximizing the distinction between target and non-target responsesâ€”for any user, at any time.

# Who Are We Looking For?
We are currently recruiting adults aged 18 years or older, with normal or corrected to normal vision, no color-blindness, and no history of neurological disorder (seizures, concussion, stroke).

# What Does a Participant Do?
Participants will take part in this study in the NCIL lab, located within the Life Science Center at the Dalhousie University Studley campus. This study will take place over a single session, lasting approximately 2 hours. The experiment will involve the use of a 32-electrode EEG system. Water soluble electrolyte gel is used to bridge the gap between the scalp and the electrodes. Once the EEG cap and electrodes have been fitted, you will be seated in a room with a monitor which will present multiple stimulus paradigms, some of which may involve flickering.
