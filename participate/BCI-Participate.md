# Brain-Computer Interfaces
{:.center}

We are recruiting adults aged 18 years or older. Please continue reading for more information!

# What is the Purpose of the Project?
Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use brain signals to control a computer. Our lab is focused on *visual selection* BCIs, in which users direct their attention to different stimuli on a computer screen, with each stimulus executing a different command. UIsing EEG, we use brain activity to determine which stimulus the user is attending to. Read more about the [brain-computer interface project here.](https://www.ncilab.ca/projects/BCI)

# Who Are We Looking For?
We are currently recruiting adults aged 18 years or older, with normal or corrected to normal vision, no color-blindness, and no history of neurological disorder (seizures, concussion, stroke).

# What Does a Participant Do?
Participants will take part in this study in the NCIL lab, located within the Life Science Center at the Dalhousie University Studley campus. This study will take place over a single session, lasting approximately 1-2 hours. The experiment will involve the use of a 32-electrode EEG system. Water soluble electrolyte gel is used to bridge the gap between the scalp and the electrodes. Once the EEG cap and electrodes have been fitted, you will be seated in a room with a monitor which will present multiple stimulus paradigms, some of which may involve flickering.
