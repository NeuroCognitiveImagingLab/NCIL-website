# Mobile Apps to Help Language Learning 
{:.center}

The goal of this study is to learn if an app is useful in helping people acquire a new language. The NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab at Dalhousie University has partnered with Simon Fraser University and the Mango Languages app to conduct this study.

## What is the Purpose of the Project?
Mobile/Computer-Assisted language learning tools are being increasingly adopted by casual language learners, and for use in formal classroom settings. However, there is limited unbiased scientific evidence investigating the quality and adequacy of these virtual language learning tools. Therefore, this research aims to determine whether learners benefit from adding language training with a language app, as an addition to any other language instruction they are receiving. 

## Status
Data collection is complete. We are currently running quantitative and qualitative data analyses.
