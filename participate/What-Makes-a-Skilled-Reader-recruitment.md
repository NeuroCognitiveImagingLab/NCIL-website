# Reading Development
{:.center}

The NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab at Dalhousie University is looking for English speaking children in grades 3, 4, and 5 to participate in a research study about reading and the brain. This study is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

## What Is This Study About?
We are doing this study to learn more about factors that contribute to literacy development and neural processes associated with reading. In addition to recognizing words, reading comprehension relies on recognition of punctuation, such aas periods and commas. We are particularly interested in how and when children's sensitivity and understanding the meaning of commas develops. The "closure positive shift" (CPS) refers to a change in brain wave activity in response to pauses in speech and commas in written text that has been observed in children during listening to speech and in adults during silent reading. We'll be testing for the CPS during silent reading of children in grades 3-5. 

Right now, our research is not looking at children with diagnosed reading disorders (like dyslexia), just at kids who are learning to read at more or less the expected level for their grade. 
In the long run, we hope this research will help us understand what causes delays or disabilities in reading, to better diagnose reading problems earlier in development, and to assist in designing individually tailored programs for reading development.

## Who Are We Looking For?
We are currently recruiting participants in grades 3, 4, and 5, who speak English at home and at school. We also require that participants have no problems with their vision or hearing (wearing glasses is OK). 

## What Will Children Do?
This study will be conducted at our lab at Dalhousie University.

 We’ll conduct brief assessments of children’s reading and related skills using standardized tasks followed by monitoring of changes in brain wave activity while children silently read. To monitor children's brain actviity we use electrencephalography, (EEG). 

## About EEG

EEG is a safe, non-invasive and child-friendly brain imaging technique that measures electrical signals in the brain. It involves wearing a soft cap on the head that holds sensors. (click [here](neuroimaging/neuroimaging/#electroencephalography-eeg) for more information).

## Will the study cost me anything and, if so, how will I be reimbursed?
There will be an honorarium (thank-you payment) to both participant and parent/guardian, regardless of whether your child completes the entire session. In appreciation for their participation, your child will receive 20 dollars. As well, we will pay the parent/guardian of the child 20 dollars to cover any expenses you might have for participating in this study, such as transportation and parking costs. Payments for each session will be paid at the conclusion of the study visit, even if your child chooses to stop participating before the session is completed.
