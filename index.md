# Welcome to NCIL!

The NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab (NCIL) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, conducts basic and applied cognitive neuroscience research. Much of our research is focused on language and neuroplasticity — how the brain changes with experience. The ultimate goal of our work is to help people live healthier, happier, and more productive lives. To this end, our activities follow a cycle including basic research, active participation in clinical settings, clinical research, and knowledge translation and application. 


NCIL is located in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq. We are all Treaty people. 

We recognize that African Nova Scotians are a distinct people whose histories, legacies and contributions have enriched that part of Mi'kma'ki known as Nova Scotia for over 400 years.

## Highlights

NCIL's research is focused on **Neuroplasticity**: how the brain is changed by experience. Neuroplasticity is an innate capacity of the brain. It includes changes that occur during development, learning (such as learning a new language), recovery from injury (such as a stroke), 
adaptation to the loss of a sense (such the loss of hearing or sight), and many other things.

In our lab, we mostly use **neuroimaging** tools like MRI and EEG to study the brain. These tools are non-invasive (they are safe and painless) and give us amazing abilities to see where and when things are happening in the brain. You can learn more about these tools under the Neuroimaging link at the top of the page.

Current research projects in the lab are focused on a number of different topics, including:
* Basic Language Processing
* Reading Development
* Second Language Learning
* Brain-Computer Interfaces
* Aphasia (an acquired language disorder)
* Advanced analysis approaches for EEG and fMRI

The NeuroCognitive Imaging lab is a group of enthusiastic researchers interested in cognitive neuroscience. Our team comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds, interests, and skill sets. This includes undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and professional research assistants. If you are interested in joining the lab as a volunteer, student, or other trainee, please contact us! 

NCIL is committed to providing a safe, diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for learning and working. We welcome trainees from all backgrounds, both locally and internationally. In particular, we welcome and encourage participation by people from African Nova Scotian and Mi'kmaq communities. We recognize the barriers to participation in academia that these and other groups have experienced, and we actively work to support future scholars from historically marginalized communities.
