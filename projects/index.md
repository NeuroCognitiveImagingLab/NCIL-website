  title="Developing a Prototype of a Computer-Based Therapy for Aphasia: Usability Testing and Preliminary Assessment of Efficacy"
  text="Aphasia is a communication disorder that affects approximately 2.5 million people in North America, however currently most people with aphasia do not receive adequate treatment. Computer-based therapies can help to address these problems as they provide people with access to a potentially cost-effective therapy, from the comfort of their own home. This project aims to develop, test, and commercialize a computer-based therapy for at-home rehabilitation of aphasia. This program has been developed, undergone initial testing, and is now recruiting participants with aphasia to participate in testing the refined design of the computer program."

  title="Project Homework: An investigation into Cognitive Factors in Remote Collaboration and Remote Work Platforms"
  text="During the covid-19 pandemic, there was a widespread adoption of remote work. However, the collaboration platforms that enable this work, may strain cognitive systems by inhibiting the ability to develop new ideas, and strain the ability to learn - due in part to increased mind wandering. This project aims to explore how the ability to sustain attention may become weaker over time and how changes in work environments can prevent it, using surveys, behavioural studies and electroencephalography (EEG). This project is currently recruiting participants."
