Aphasia is a communication disorder that affects approximately 2.5 million people in North America, however currently most people with aphasia do not receive adequate treatment. Computer-based therapies can help to address these problems as they provide people with access to a potentially cost-effective therapy, from the comfort of their own home. This project aims to develop, test, and commercialize a computer-based therapy for at-home rehabilitation of aphasia. This program has been developed, undergone initial testing, and is now recruiting participants with aphasia to participate in testing the refined design of the computer program.

During the covid-19 pandemic, there was a widespread adoption of remote work. However, the collaboration platforms that enable this work, may strain cognitive systems by inhibiting the ability to develop new ideas, and strain the ability to learn - due in part to increased mind wandering. This project aims to explore how the ability to sustain attention may become weaker over time and how changes in work environments can prevent it, using surveys, behavioural studies and electroencephalography (EEG). This project is currently recruiting participants.

A brain-computer interface (BCI) is an electronic system that can convert an individual’s brain activity into control commands to operate devices, allowing systems to receive input directly from task-related brain signals. For this reason, BCIs offer promising assistive technology solutions for people suffering with severe motor dysfunction. This project aims to maximize the performance of a BCI to distinguish target responses, for any user, at any time. This project will be recruiting participants beginning in January of 2023.

What Makes a Skilled Reader? The Neurocognitive Imaging Lab needs your help to find out! We’re looking for students in Grades 2 & 3 who speak English at home and at school, with normal hearing and normal (or corrected to normal) vision, to take part in a longitudinal neuroimaging study. The goal of the study is to characterize how individual differences in reading skills relate to children’s patterns of brain activation, and how these relationships change from Grade 2 to Grade 5. This project will be recruiting participants in 2023.

Learning a new language is challenging for most adults, and it has been shown that it can be more difficult if the learner is using their first language during the process. Therefore, this project investigates adult language learning of Welsh words, and uses electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how speaking English versions of the newly learned Welsh words will alter brain activity. This project will be recruiting participants in 2023.

MADworld-Mango is part of a larger, multi-partner study, _Ensuring Full Literacy in a Multicultural and Digital World_, under the direction of Dr. Janet F. Werker at the University of British Columbia. MADworld-Mango is a collaboration between PIs Aaron Newman of Dalhousie University, Henny Yeung of Simon Fraser University, and Mango Languages, USA. Consistent with the larger study, MADworld-Mango addresses a major issue confronting society: literacy and how to bridge literacy acquisition within a multicultural and digitally-connected world.  This project has formed a research-industry-community partnership to evaluate the efficacy of a digital learning platform designed to assist newcomers to Canada improve their English abilities. After 8 weeks of online participation, we’ll evaluate learners’ benefit from additional training with a language app to any other instruction they are receiving.
