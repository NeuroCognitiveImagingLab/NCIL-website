# PROCESS IN ADULT SECOND LANGUAGE AQUISITION

We use electroencephalography (EEG) to research adult language learning. EEG allows us to measure small voltages generated in the brain in relation to changes in someone’s cognitive state. Learning a new language is challenging for most adults, so its important to understand the processes that facilitate and interfere with second language acquisition. With EEG we can better understand and measure language acquisition processes at the neural level.

First and foremost, this research aims to explore neural processes underlying vocabulary learning in a new language.  Moreover, we are investigating how using one’s native language can affect this language related neural process. In parallel we are conducting an online study to explore behavioural outcomes in language learning.

## Current State of Project

Data collection for these projects is ongoing with plans to conduct additional experiments in the future with opportunities for new students to join the team. Data analysis is currently underway: we will have preliminary results by the end of summer 2024. 

## Funding Sources

Funding comes from the NSGS-Doctoral scholarship.
