# Machine Learning in Visual Electrodiagnostics (eyeAI)

## Rationale

The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of how machine learning can aid our clinical team (IWK Health Centre) in diagnosing and managing disorders affecting how visual information is communicated to the brain. Machine learning is a field of study within computer science, which uses complex mathematical models to find patterns in data and then use those patterns to make predictions, such as whether someone has a medical condition or not. 

## Overview Of The Current Study

We are interested in how patterns of retinal (inner eye) and brain electrical activity might help us better diagnose eye conditions. We measure this activity using electrodes placed on the skin. We currently use these recordings in clinic to help determine where your visual issues may be originating. This has proven very helpful when we canâ€™t see physical signs of changes during your eye examination. Many factors (like not wearing the right glasses) can affect these recordings and create challenges when trying to interpret these findings accurately.

For this study we are interested in looking at the data obtained from the visual testing commonly ordered by Ophthalmologists/Neurologists. Common test(s) you may be booked for include Visually Evoked Potentials (VEPs) and Electroretinograms (ERGs). VEPs measure the electrical response related to a visual target from your brain using a sticker (electrode) placed on your scalp (head). ERGs measure the electrical response related to a visual target from your retina (tissue in the back of your eye) using a thread placed on your lower eyelid. This is a very similar concept of having an electrocardiogram (heart function test) done in a clinic, where stickers are placed on your chest, and we see the electrical activity of your heart beating on a monitor.

## Objectives

With sufficient patricipants we hypothesize that the machine learning algorithm will be able to: 
1. Distinguish visual electrophysiology waveforms as normal or abnormal given age and other clinical data 
2. Quantify the severity of an abnormality
3. Identify the cause of pathology in the waveform, given additional information from the individual's ocular exam. 

## Recruitment

Recruitment for this study is ongoing and open to any interested volunteers, with or without eye conditions. Participation in this study involves coming into the IWK Eye Clinic Visual Electrodiagnostic Lab for one (1) session and completing an eye examination, visual electrodiagnostic testing, and ocular photography. 
1. The eye exam consists of similar testing you may have experienced at an optometrist including, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and color vision testing. 
2. The visual electrodiagnostic testing requires you to look at various patterns or lights while electrodes placed on your skin or lower eyelid record activity from your visual system. 
3. Ocular photography includes taking photos of the back of your eye using specialized cameras. 

All of these tests are commonly done in our clinic, and in this study we will perform the tests in the same way we would with patients. Participation in this study would take approximately 60-90 minutes of your time. This study has been reviewed and approved by the IWK Research Ethics Board.
