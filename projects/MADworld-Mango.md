## Mobile Apps to Help Acquisition of a New Language

The goal of this study is to learn if a digital app is useful in helping learners of a new language. The NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab at Dalhousie University has partnered with Simon Fraser University and Mango Languages to conduct this study.

Mobile/Computer-Assisted language learning tools are being increasingly adopted by casual language learners, and for use in formal classroom settings. However, there is limited unbiased scientific evidence investigating the quality and adequacy of these virtual language learning tools. Therefore, this research aims to determine whether learners benefit from adding language training within a language app, as an addition to any other language instruction they are receiving.

## What Were Participants Asked to Do
We are no longer recruiting participants.  

Participants completed several online questionnaires and assessments. They were asked to use the Mango Languages app intended to help improve acquisition of a new language. Participants were asked to use the app at least 1 hour per week, for a period of 8 weeks. Recommended usage was 20 minutes, 3 times per week. At the end of 8 weeks, participants were asked to do a final test of their new language abilities.

## Who Could Take Part in this Research Study

Participants in this study were:

Age 17 years or older,

Currently living in Canada,

And met criteria in one of the 3 conditions:
1. Not a native English speaker, and a fluent speaker of one of the languages for which Mango Languages has an ESL program (Mango Languages provides ESL courses for speakers of over 20 languages, including Bengali, Haitian Creole, Hmong, Mandarin, Arabic (Egyptian), Arabic (MSA), Armenian, Cantonese, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese).

2. Enrolled in a Spanish language learning class but not fluent in Spanish

Participants also needed use of a computer or mobile device that meets the minimum technical requirements of the online platforms used for this study.


## What is the Purpose of the Project?

Mobile/Computer-Assisted language learning tools are being increasingly adopted by casual language learners, and for use in formal classroom settings. However, there is limited unbiased scientific evidence investigating the quality and adequacy of these virtual language learning tools. Therefore, this research aims to determine whether learners benefit from adding language training within a language app, as an addition to any other language instruction they are receiving.

## Compensation and Benefits

During the study, particiants were given free access to a language learning program on Mango Languages with the intention of improving acquisition of a new language.

Language assessments in the learned language were administered online by the True North at the start and end of the study. This test provided scores that can be compared to widely-used tests of language ability, such as CEFR and ACTFL. participants received documentation of their test scores.
