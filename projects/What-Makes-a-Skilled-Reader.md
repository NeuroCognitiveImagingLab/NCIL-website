# Reading Development


## Project Rationale
One of the most valuable skills we learn is how to read. Reading skill is essential for academic and career success. For some children, learning to read is a challenging task, and this begs the question: Why are some children stronger readers than others? Being able to understand individual differences in reading development provides the opportunity to design better reading education programs that provide personalised teaching strategies for individual children’s needs.


## What do we already know?
Reading comprehension depends not only on recognizing words but also on interpreting sentence structure through recognizing punctuation cues, such as commas. This awareness of punctuation and sensitivity to comma placement has been shown to correlate with understanding of sentence structure and overall reading comprehension. 


## Overview of the Current Study
{% capture text %}
To build on previous research examining the relationships between brain activity and reading ability, the present study will recruit children from grades 3–5 to participate in one session lasting approximately 60 minutes. During this session we will examine their neural activity patterns in response to individual words and sentences. To look at children's brain activity, we will be using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a child-friendly brain imaging technique that measures electrical signals in the brain. (click [here](neuroimaging/neuroimaging/#electroencephalography-eeg) for more information). With EEG, and standardized measures of reading ability, we can then investigate if more differentiated brain responses, to different words, are related to better reading skill.

## Objectives
The goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between reading skills and children's brain responses to words, so that we can better understand how individual differences in brain activity relate to children’s future reading abilities.


## Current State of the Study
We plan to resume data collection in the late fall of 2025. If you would like more information on participating or volunteering in this study, please contact us at reading_brains@dal.ca.
