# Neural correlates of the Production Effect
 
**Rationale of the project**
The Production Effect is a well-documented phenomenon whereby we are better at remembering words we have spoken aloud, compared to words that we have read silently. At present, this effect has been studied only from a behavioural point of view. Therefore, its neural underpinnings are poorly understood.
 
**Overview of the current study**
The overall goal of this project is to better understand the neural underpinnings of the Production Effect and, more generally, the different brain dynamics involved in reading aloud versus reading silently. We use fMRI to record participants’ brain activity while they read words aloud and silently, and later as they are being tested on the words they read. Therefore, we get a record of their brain activity during encoding (i.e., when they are forming memories of the words they are reading) and during retrieval (when they are remembering the words that they read).
We are using a few different approaches to analysing our fMRI data. These different approaches can tell us different things about the data. On the one hand, we are using conventional univariate analyses to understand which brain areas are activated when reading aloud and reading silently, and how these differences in activation relate to participants’ memory performance. We are also using multivariate analyses—a relatively new approach to analyzing fMRI data—which can reveal more fine-grained brain dynamics.
 
**Analysis objectives**
We are also using multivariate analyses—a relatively new approach to analyzing fMRI data—to understand (1) how brain activity during encoding is re-instated during retrieval, and (2) how different kinds of information are represented in the brain while reading aloud versus reading silently. For example, is articulatory information represented more strongly when reading aloud?
 
**Current state of the study**
As of now, we have completed fMRI data collection. The results of our univariate analyses have already been published (Bailey et al., 2021). Our multivariate analyses are ongoing, and we hope to publish two papers reporting on these analyses within the next year.
