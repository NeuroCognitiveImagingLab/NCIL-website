# Beyond Volunteering — Courses, a Certificate, and more

There are opportunities to do PSYO/NESC 3100/3001 independent research projects leading up to an honours thesis the following year. I will normally only agree to supervise honours students who have completed 3100/3101 under my supervision, due to the extent of background knowledge and lab technique development required to complete an honours project in cognitive neuroscience (although completion of 3100/3101 does not guarantee an agreement to supervise honours). 

I also strongly suggest that you enrol in two courses that I developed, which are perfectly-aligned with the research techniques we use in NCIL — including EEG and data science in Python. The two courses I recommend you take are NESC/PSYO 3137, Research Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience, and NESC/PSYO 3505, Neural Data Science. These courses teach you the things you need to do a research project in NCIL (like honours), and are fundamental to work in the areas such as neurotechnology, med-tech more generally, and data science even more generally. We work with complex, multidimensional data and advanced statistical and machine learning models — the only way you can do productive work in these fields is to commit to developing this technical know-how.

## Certificate in Neurotechnology Innovation

I also recommend the [Certificate in Neurotechnology Innovation](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/neurotech_certificate/#content) that I created and run. The two courses above count towards the certificate, and the other requirements position you well for future study or work in neurotech and data science. 

Finally, I also direct the [SURGE Science Innovation Sandbox](https://www.surgeinnovation.ca/). This is an “innovation lab” for the Faculty of Science, where we teach and support innovation, design thinking, and entrepreneurial thinking. This includes hackathons (including our annual brain-computer interface hackathon in March), introductory coding workshops for R and Python, interdisciplinary design thinking programs on topics like accessibility and food security, and support for science students interested in trying to develop a science-based entrepreneurial venture (including for- and non-profit business models).
