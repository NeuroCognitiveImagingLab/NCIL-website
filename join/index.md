The NeuroCognitive Imaging lab is a group of enthusiastic researchers interested in cognitive neuroscience. Our team comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds, interests, and skill sets. This includes undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and professional research assistants. If you are interested in joining the lab as a volunteer, student, or other trainee, please contact us!

NCIL is committed to providing a safe, diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for learning and working. We welcome trainees from all backgrounds, both locally and internationally. In particular, we welcome and encourage participation by people from African Nova Scotian and Mi’kmaq communities. We recognize the barriers to participation in academia that these and other groups have experienced, and we actively work to support future scholars from historically marginalized communities.

# Undergraduate Students
NCIL always has many undergraduate students in the lab, getting experience with cognitive neuroscience research. Lab experience in general is a great way to learn about the process of scientific research, and to develop critical thinking and writing skills. This can be valuable for a variety of educational and career paths, including graduate study in cognitive neuroscience, or many other fields (e.g., clinical professions, law, entrepreneurship).

Many students start by volunteering, and then move on to enrolling in independent research and then the honours thesis if they are passionate about the work and demonstrate the required skills. 

## Volunteers
We are always keen to take on new volunteers. However, due to high demand and the training involved, we only accept volunteers at the start of Fall term, and sometimes at the start of Winter term if spots become available. We do not take new volunteers in the summer.

We generally ask all volunteers to make a **minimum 3 hour/week commitment** to the lab. We won’t necessarily have 3 hours of work each week for you, but at times when the lab is busy, we do. Volunteers typically help with data collection (EEG and behavioural), data entry, organizational tasks around data management, stimulus development, etc.. We find that 3 hours/week is a reasonable amount of time to actually learn something from your experience over the course of a term, and decide if you want to get more deeply involved in a project.

Rather than schedule volunteers at specific times/days of the week, we post all volunteer opportunities on our communication platform (Basecamp), and we expect you to sign up for those that you are available for. As well, **you should try to attend weekly lab meetings** so we get to know your face, and get familiar with the many projects going on in the lab. Times and locations for the meetings are posted on Basecamp, and we hold them hybrid with a Zoom option if you can’t make it to the LSC.

## Honours Theses
If you are interested in doing an honours thesis in NCIL, please note that **Dr. Newman will only take on honours students who have completed PSYO/NESC 3100/3101 (Independent Research) under his supervision, with a grade of A- or better**. An honours thesis in cognitive neuroscience is a significant undertaking, and the independent research project ensures that students go into honours with proper training and expectations.

We do not require undergraduate students to have any specific skills when starting work in the lab, although we generally require that you have completed first year university, including 6 credit hours in Introductory Psychology & Neuroscience. With that said, there are numerous skills that you should aim to develop if you wish to work and be successful in the lab. These include scientific computing skills, including working with the command line and basic programming (we primarily use the Python and R languages), as well as a grounding in the principles of cognitive neuroscience research techniques. These can be developed in a variety of ways, but a good choice is to enroll in the courses Dr. Newman has developed, including PSYO/NESC 3137, Research Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience, and PSYO/NESC 3505, Neural Data Science.

# Graduate Training
Graduate studies in the NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab may be pursued through [Dalhousie’s graduate program in Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience/programs/graduate-programs.html). We offer MSc and PhD degrees in basic research, as well as a PhD in Clinical Psychology. Most NCIL graduate students are in the basic research program, because the demands of learning and mastering neuroimaging techniques along with those of the clinical PhD program do not generally create a favourable work-life balance.

The research-focused graduate program in Psychology and Neuroscience at Dalhousie is best described as an “apprenticeship” program; there are relatively few courses, and students are expected to focus primarily on learning and conducting research under the guidance of their supervisor. 

While many people pursue graduate studies with an aim of becoming a university professor, the reality is that these are few and far between — on average, less than 30% of people with PhDs in life science fields end up with such jobs. However, graduate training prepares you for numerous other careers and professions, and it is important to pursue additional professional skills training during your graduate degree. Indeed, one of Dr. Newman's passions is developing and delivering programs to prepare graduate students to make an impact on the world through careers outside of academia. Some of the opportunities at Dalhousie include the [Dal GradPD](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/current-students/professional-development/gradpd.html) (professional development) certificate, the certificate in [University Teaching and Learning](https://www.dal.ca/dept/clt/programs/CUTL.html), workshops offered through the [SURGE](https://surgeinnovation.ca) science innovation sandbox, and entrepreneurial training programs offered by [Dal Innovates](https://dalinnovates.ca) or the national [invention2Innovation](https://beedie.sfu.ca/programs/graduate/invention-to-innovation) program.

Ideally, students wishing to pursue graduate studies in the NeuroCognitive Imaging lab should have a demonstrated experience conducting scientific research (i.e., honours thesis or equivalent), and background in two or more of the following fields:

- Cognitive Psychology
- Linguistics
- Neuroscience
- Functional MRI, ERP, or other functional neuroimaging techniques (e.g. MEG, PET, fNIRS)
- Signal Processing
- Statistics

If you are interested in applying for graduate studies under Dr. Newman's supervision, please email him to discuss. Please also review the [information on applying to our graduate program](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience/programs/graduate-programs/application-procedures.html) (including program deadlines). 

# Postdoctoral Studies
Graduate training should provide you with a solid foundation as a scientist, including critical thinking skills, a comprehensive knowledge base in your chosen field, and necessary research skills. The goal of postdoctoral training is to provide the advanced training necessary to enable you to become an independent researcher. You will continue to do research, but there are numerous other skills to be learned as well, such as lab management, grant writing, and teaching and supervising students.

Ideally, a postdoctoral fellowship will also allow you to broaden your horizons, by learning new research techniques, and/or doing research in a slightly different focus from your graduate work. Many people who studied cognitive science or linguistics in graduate school use their postdoctoral years to learn neuroimaging techniques. Others, who have studied topics such as physics, engineering, computer science, or physiology, may be interested in mastering the skills of cognitive science.

If you are interested in postdoctoral training, please contact Dr. Newman. Postdoctoral scholars must have a strong enough track record to obtain their own funding, as our lab does not have funding available to support postdocs. Funding is available through a number of agencies, including [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca), [SSHRC](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca), [CIHR](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca), [Mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca/en), and Dalhousie’s prestigious [Killam](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/why-dal/killam-advantage.html) prizes.
