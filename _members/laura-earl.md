Laura is a fourth year student from Novar, Ontario majoring in Neuroscience, minoring in Entrepreneurship and completing a certificate in Neurotechnology and Innovation. Last year she completed an independent project as part of the brain computer interface (BCI) team looking at the effect of stimulus hybridization on EEG signals and BCI performance. This years project, supervised by Dr. Aaron Newman, will focus on the efficacy and usability of motor imagery, and steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), -based BCIs. In her free time Laura enjoys reading, road trips and baking.
