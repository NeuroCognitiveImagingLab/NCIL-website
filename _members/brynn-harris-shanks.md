Brynn completed a “Brynndependent” and honours project at NCIL looking at the effects of stimulus colour and orientation on EEG signals and brain computer interface (BCI) performance. She has now graduated and is continuing to work on the BCI project as a research assistant. Over the course of her research Brynn has developed a passion for all things neurotechnology and shares this with others as a BCI specialist at Surge Innovation’s Neurotech club. She helps provide students hands-on experience with all the components of BCIs - general neuroscience, electroencephalography, data science, and machine learning. Outside the lab, Brynn likes to run and shop for vintage and second-hand clothes.
