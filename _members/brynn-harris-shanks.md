Brynn has been a NCIL member for the past two years. She completed her third-year “Brynndependent” research project where she ran a pilot study to validate stimuli and develop an experimental protocol for the first stage of Danny Godfrey’s brain-computer interface thesis. Currently, Brynn is an honours student in the lab working on a continuation of her independent research project. She is looking at the effects of stimulus colour and orientation on EEG signals and brain computer interface (BCI) performance. Brynn hopes to continue working on BCI research and one day work for a neurotechnology company. Outside of the lab, Brynn likes to listen to podcasts, go running, and hang out with her friends.
