At Dalhousie University, Saisha discovered her passion for neurolinguistics while completing her BSc (Honours) in Neuroscience. With an interest in reading development, she began her MSc in Psychology and Neuroscience under the supervision of Professor Aaron Newman. Currently, Saisha is interested in how brain activity patterns are associated with reading and related skills. Her current project uses fMRI to investigate how children’s brains represent individual words. Outside the lab, Saisha enjoys drawing and learning dance choreography.
