Laura is a Masters of Science student at Dalhousie University, currently working on the 'What Makes a Skilled Reader?' project. During this project, Laura is looking forward to using neuroimaging tools to investigate individual differences in how children's brains represent words. Prior to her Master's, Laura began her involvement on this project as an Honours level student. Laura completed her Bachelor of Science, with Honours in Neuroscience, a Certificate in Animal Behaviour, and a Certificate in Neurotechnology and Innovation at Dalhousie University, in 2022. After completing her undergraduate degree, Laura continued to work on this project the following summer in a student research position. Outside of the lab Laura volunteers her time with the Mood Disorder Society of Canada group 'Halifax Defeat Depression', and loves to get outside hiking, windsurfing, or skating.
