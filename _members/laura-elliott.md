Laura is a graduate student in Clinical Psychology at Dalhousie University, currently working on the ‘What Makes a Skilled Reader?’ project. During this project, Laura is looking forward to using neuroimaging tools to understand how children's brain activation changes during reading, over the course of reading development. Prior to beginning the Clinical Psychology program, Laura completed her Masters of Science in the lab, using fMRI to investigate brain activity during single word reading in children. Outside of the lab Laura volunteers her time with the Healthy Minds Cooperative, Mood Disorder Society of Canada group ‘Halifax Defeat Depression’, and loves to go hiking and camping in the summer, or skiing and skating in the winter.
