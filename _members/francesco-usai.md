I am a Biomedical Engineer by training, now pursuing my doctoral studies in Psychology and Neuroscience. Here at NCIL I work at the interface between these fields: on the one hand my thesis work is centred around developing and testing software that can make best available treatments for speech and language more accessible to people with aphasia; on the other hand, working with a clinical population offers me a wide and privileged window onto the study of cognition, a field that has fascinated me since my early days as a university student.
