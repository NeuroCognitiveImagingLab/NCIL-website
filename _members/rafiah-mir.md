Rafiah is a third-year Neuroscience student at Dalhousie University. She has always been passionate about cognitive neuroscience and began volunteering in the lab at the beginning of her second year. This year she is starting an independent study project under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman, continuing on with the “Hyperscanning” project based on collected neuroimaging data from two people, using a single EEG system simultaneously. Outside of the lab, Rafiah loves watercolor painting, reading, and being an indoor plant mom.
