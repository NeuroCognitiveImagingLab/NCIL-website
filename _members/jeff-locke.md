Jeff is a PhD student in Biology, co-supervised by Dr. Newman. He is also an adjunct assistant professor within the Faculty of Health for the Clinical Vision Science (CVS) program, teaching _Therapeutic and Psychosocial Aspects of Low Vision_, and a lecturer within the Department of Ophthalmology (Dalhousie) teaching medical students, ophthalmology residents and speciality fellows. Jeff completed his undergraduate degree (biology) at Cape Breton University, and his MSc in Clinical Vision Science (CVS) at Dalhousie University (2018). Heâ€™s been working within the field of Ophthalmology over the past decade as an Orthoptist/Ophthalmic Medical Technologist, at SickKids (Toronto, Ontario) and the IWK (Halifax, Nova Scotia), specializing in clinical visual electrophysiology. Jeff currently directs the visual electrodiagnostic lab at the IWK Health Centre, and his research focuses on applying machine learning methods for processing electroretinogram (ERG), pattern electroretinogram (PERG), and visually evoked potential (VEP) signals to detect pathology in the visual system in both people and animal models of ocular disease.  Outside of work and the lab Jeff enjoys CrossFit, hiking (especially in the Fall), and trivia.
