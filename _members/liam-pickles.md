Liam is a fourth-year Neuroscience student doing the Neurotechnology and Innovation certificate and a full-year honours project with NCIL. He started volunteering with the EEG Word Reading project and moved to the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) project. He will spend the upcoming year researching the impact of prolonged BCI use and fatigue. Liam hopes to pursue a medicine-related future and to integrate what he knows about neuro-technology along the way. Outside academics, Liam is an avid cyclist, music connoisseur and computer hobbyist. In his free time, he also enjoys discovering and exploring new places around Halifax.
