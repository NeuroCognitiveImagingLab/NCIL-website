Sarah graduated from Mount Saint Vincent University (MSVU) in 2010 with a Bachelor of Applied Arts in Child and Youth Study and went on to own and run a licensed childcare facility in Halifax for eleven years. Sarah returned to MSVU to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Psychology (graduated 2024), where a keen interest in the impacts of childhood trauma and a love of research were born. She is currently enrolled in the Clinical Psychology program at Dalhousie University (Dal), under the co-supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman and Dr. Christine Lackner. Using EEG, Sarahâ€™s first graduate project will look at whether selective attention related to individual differences in self-regulation are domain-general or domain-specific (i.e., auditory and/or visual). When not in the lab, Sarah loves to escape to the beach, have a BBQ, or spend time with her family.
