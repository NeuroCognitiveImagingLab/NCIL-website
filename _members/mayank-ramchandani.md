Mayank is a fourth-year undergraduate student finishing his Bachelors of Science Double Majors in Neuroscience and Computer Science, with a certificate in Neurotechnology and Innovation. He is very interested in how existing BCI systems can be used, or new ones be created to explore different paradigms, especially in the emotional affective area. This year, Mayank is very excited to be doing an independent study project working with Raphael, and in the supervision of Colin Conrad on the impact of AI on decision making, particularly with respect to politics. In his spare time, Mayank loves being outdoors in nature, and he likes to spend time with friends and play a variety of sports. If you have any questions or ideas, please reach out to him. He is also a member of NeuroTechX.
