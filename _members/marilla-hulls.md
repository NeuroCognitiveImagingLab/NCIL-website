Marilla is a fourth year neuroscience student with a minor in English. Currently, she is completing her honours project under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman. She is learning about neuroimaging tools such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and how they can be applied to reading development research. Outside of the lab, Marilla is a Brain Awareness Week coordinator with Dalhousie Universityâ€™s Undergraduate Neuroscience Society where she helps to plan events and create educational content making knowledge about the brain accessible to the general public. In her spare time, she enjoys yoga and curling up with a good book.
