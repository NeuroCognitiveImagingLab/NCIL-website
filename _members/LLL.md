The [Language and Literacy Lab (LLL)](https://langlabatdal.weebly.com/) at Dalhousie University is led by [Dr. Hélène Deacon](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience/faculty-staff/our-faculty/helene-deacon.html), an internationally regarded researcher in the field of reading. Dr. Deacon is a Professor in the [Psychology and Neuroscience Department](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience.html) at Dalhousie University, a Member of the College of the Royal Society of Canada, and co-Director of the 2.5 million dollar Partnership Grant: [Ensuring Full Literacy in a Multicultural and Digital World](https://ensuringliteracy.ca/). Dr. Deacon has world-renowned expertise in reading development, with active collaborative research examining the intersection of education with health outcomes.

The LLL consists of an interdisciplinary and diverse team of researchers who support a large-scale research program dedicated to understanding the skills children and adults need to achieve full literacy. Team members include postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, volunteers, and research staff. We work in a friendly and collaborative environment that includes weekly lab meetings and social (sometimes adventurous!) outings. The LLL frequently connects outside of the lab to enjoy events like picnics, food truck festivals, coastal hikes, kayaking, ziplining, and cultural events. The team is supported by a full-time lab manager and is connected, both nationally and internationally, to a wonderful group of collaborators who often come to visit, join in meetings, and give colloquium talks.
