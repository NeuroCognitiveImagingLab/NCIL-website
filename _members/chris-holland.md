Chris is a PhD candidate studying Experimental Neuroscience. Chris came to Halifax to pursue an academic background in Kinesiology, and completed both his Bachelors of Science and a Masters of Science in Kinesiology. Chris has been fortunate to be able to pursue his interest in the use of technology in health sciences, specifically with a focus on neuroimaging and machine learning. Some of Chris’ biggest passions are in visual arts (photography and graphic design specifically), and philanthropy.  When he’s not out on a new adventure, usually he can be found at the library consumed by books or his academic research.
