My name is Liza and I am a beginner neuroscientist from Ukraine. I have taken my bachelor's as a biologist and my specialization is called Physiology of a human and animals. I have been interested in how the human brain works since school and I am very excited about all the opportunities that different methods of neurobiology give us to explore such a complicated structure. I currently work with EEG as it allows to see how the human brain "reacts" on the stimula and how this changes through the time. It is very difficult to highlight one single field of interest for research because everything seems to be incredibly interesting. However, I worked the most in the fields of neurolinguistics, art-therapy and neurodiversity. I also work at the clinic that helps children with ASD and epilepsy ease the manifestations of the disease.
I am glad for the opportunity to be the member of Aaron's lab, even though it was a short-term experience as a visitor researcher here. I am grateful for all the members for such a cool and fruitful experience and time we had together.
