Cory is a PhD Candidate in Psychology and Neuroscience, though his undergraduate background is in Kinesiology. Broadly, Cory is interested in understanding whether -- and particularly, how -- aspects of brain health (e.g., cognitive function) can be influenced by lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity levels, dietary habits). Outside of the lab Cory enjoys listening to music and hiking.
