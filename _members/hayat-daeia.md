I’m a second-year undergraduate Medical Sciences student. As part of DISP last year, I conducted research on SSVEP BCIs, writing my second scientific paper under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman and Max Mascini. I am back in the lab as a volunteer. Outside of academia, I’m an executive member of several societies at Dal, a patient partner with the IWK and the MSSDU, and in a nationwide research project on reducing diabetic stigma. I love spending my money on my cat, discovering new cafés, and studying with friends.
