Devon is in her fourth year of a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience. She is very interested in childhood reading development, and is completing an independent research project in this area, under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman. She is excited to gain experience working with brain imaging devices, and using these to learn more about children’s brain activity. In Devon’s free time she volunteers with United for Literacy as an ESL tutor, and enjoys cooking, spending time with friends, and listening to true crime podcasts.
