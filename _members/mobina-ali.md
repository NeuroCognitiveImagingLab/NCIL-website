Mobina is a fourth-year Psychology undergraduate student at Dalhousie University. Under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman, she is conducting an independent research study using EEG to detect the N400 effect (an event-related brain potential) in participants learning a new language. Using EEG responses, this study aims to determine how much vocabulary training is necessary to elicit an N400 in a second language. In her spare time, Mobina enjoys painting, running, biking, and hiking.
