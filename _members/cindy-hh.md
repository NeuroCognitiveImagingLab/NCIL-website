Cindy has been the Lab Manager at NCIL since 2017. She has undergraduate degrees from Queen’s and Mount Saint Vincent Universities and completed her PhD at Dalhousie in 2016. Social cognition was her topic of research during her graduate studies with an emphasis on non-verbal interactions, in particular what she termed ‘situated emotion recognition’.  Fast forward - Cindy’s excited by the language processing research undertaken at NCIL. She enthusiastically supports researchers in the lab and provides volunteers with training opportunities. In her downtime, Cindy is writing about empathy and hiking in Stonehurst with Kelsey.
