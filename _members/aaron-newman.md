I am a scientist, educator, and author, working at Dalhousie University where I am a Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. I hold cross-appointments in Psychiatry, Pediatrics, and Surgery, and a member of the [Brain Repair Centre](https://www.brainrepair.ca). My research examines relationships between brain activity and thought using a variety neuroimaging tools. I direct the NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab (NCIL), where I train students in cognitive neuroscience research as we study how experience affects the brain in contexts such as learning, reading, and stroke recovery. I am also the author of two textbooks: [Research Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/research-methods-for-cognitive-neuroscience/book242924) (SAGE Publishing) and [Data Science for Psychology and Neuroscience â€” In Python](https://neuraldatascience.io/intro.html) (Open Access).

Another facet of my work is training scientists at all levels to be more creative and critical thinkers, to understand design thinking and entrepreneurship, and to find and solve important problems within and beyond academia. I do this through the [SURGE Innovation Sandbox](https://www.surgeinnovation.ca) at Dalhousie, where I develop and deliver classes, workshops, hackathons, and other programming.
