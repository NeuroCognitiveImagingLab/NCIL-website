Lucy is from St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador, and is completing her BA in Psychology. Lucy is currently working on her Honours project with Dr. Colin Conrad, called Project Homework. This project looks to validate a behavioural measure of mind wandering in an online task, where sustained attention is required. Lucy is interested in pursuing a graduate degree in counseling psychology. Outside of school, Lucy likes to hike, kayak, or hit up a local drag show.
