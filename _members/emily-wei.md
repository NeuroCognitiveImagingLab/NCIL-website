Emily is a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Neuroscience, minoring in Business, and doing a certificate in Neurotechnology and Innovation. This year she will be doing an independent research study under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman. This study aims to determine how EEG activity changes during second language learning and, in particular, examining how EEG measures are related to how well people are able to learn new vocabulary. Outside of studying, Emily loves walking her dog, crocheting, and drinking matcha.
