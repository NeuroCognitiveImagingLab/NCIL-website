Emily is a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Neuroscience, minoring in Business, and doing a certificate in Neurotechnology and Innovation. She is completing her honours research under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman as part of the ComChERP study. This project examines how neural markers associated with processing prosodic boundaries, such as commas, relate to reading comprehension in children from grades 3 to 5. Last year, she conducted an independent project with the LANGA team examining neural markers involved in second language acquisition. Outside of academics, Emily enjoys walking her dog, reading, and drinking matcha.
