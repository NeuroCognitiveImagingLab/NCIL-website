Clare is a fourth-year undergraduate student studying neuroscience with a minor in philosophy. She recently completed an independent study project with the lab and is excited to be starting her honours project. She has previously loved helping with the 'fNIRS test-retest reliability study', and will continue looking at the neural mechanisms of reading with her honours project which is using combined fNIRS and EEG during a syntactic parsing task. Outside of the lab, Clare loves hiking, camping and spending time with friends.
