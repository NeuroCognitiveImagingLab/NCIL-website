Max is a fourth-year undergraduate student finishing his Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience. Max is very interested in how modern technologies can be adapted to the brain and how that bridge can be used to improve peopleâ€™s everyday lives. This year, Max is very excited to be doing an independent study project under the supervision of Daniel Godfrey, working on his research investigating brain-computer interfaces. In his spare time, Max loves being outdoors in nature, and when he is not hiking or biking, likes to spend time with friends and play video games.
