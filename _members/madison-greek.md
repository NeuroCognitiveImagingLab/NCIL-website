Madison is a third year Neuroscience undergraduate student at Dalhousie University. She is completing her independent research study working with EEG activity associated with word reading under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Newman. This study aims to determine whether we are able to decode the identity of an individual word, or its properties, from the EEG response.  In Madisons’s free time she enjoys reading, hiking, grabbing a coffee with friends, and visiting her hometown of Lunenburg.
