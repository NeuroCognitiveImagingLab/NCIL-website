Colin Conrad, PhD is an Assistant Professor at Dalhousie's Faculty of Management with expertise spans the management, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience disciplines. He oversees original projects about information technology which push disciplinary boundaries, usually about educational technology or social media, employing new methods in human-computer interaction, EEG, and data science. He is particularly interested in supervising or co-supervising honours students who want to pursue projects related to cognitive and affective processes at play when people use mobile devices or web apps.
